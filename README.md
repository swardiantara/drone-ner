Drone Named Entity Recognition

This is a repo for companion of my paper [Named Entity Recognition for Drone Forensic Using BERT and DistilBERT](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9862916/)

To reproduce the result as stated in the paper, rerun the jupyter notebook file, and adjust the parameter or the model type as needed.
